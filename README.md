# Avalon Hill Remastered
Back at the dawn of time (the 1980s) when the first desktop computers were appearing, Avalon Hill produced a series of games.

Written in BASIC, as the more-or-less common language of the various 8-bit computers of the time, they were pretty good games, given the limitations of the time,

Remember, 16Kb was a lot of memory for the time, and the processing speeds were a fraction of what they are today.

These were purely text based, not a graphic in sight

Never-the-less, me and my friends had a lot of fun playing them.

These games are pretty comprehensively Abandonware these days.

It occured to me that these games could run in a web page these days...
and so, I've started doing conversions to do just that.

NOTE: these are written in Javascript and run entirely within the web page. Reloading the page will restart the game.

I'm currently hosting the playable games here: [Avalon Hill Remastered](https://studio13.mithril.com.au/avalon_hill.html)
