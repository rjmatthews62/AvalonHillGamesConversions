    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>This game pits the Bismarck against the British Home
        Fleet in a desperate attempt to bring England to her knees
        by sinking merchant ships or by dealing a decisive blow to
        her Home Fleet. The action occurs during the spring of
        1941 in, the North Atlantic Ocean.</p>
    <h3>OBJECT OF THE GAME</h3>
    <p>You are the Captain of the Bismarck; the computer
        handles the British Home Fleet, convoys, and airsearch.
        The game is played on a 12 x 12 grid representing a portion of the Atlantic Ocean. The object of the game for
        you is to sink as many British merchant ships and battleships as possible while bringing the Bismarck back to
        port. The object for the computer is to sink the Bismarck
        as quickly as possible or at least force it back to port
        before substantial damage can be done to the British
        forces.</p>
    <h3>GAME DISPLAY</h3>
    <p>The basic game display is the 12 x 12 grid which will
        be printed on the screen at the start of each Strategic
        Turn. Each grid zone represents approximately 10,000
        square miles and is printed as a sequence of three
        characters. <span class="highlight">'.'</span> is empty ocean and <span class="highlight">'*'</span> is a German port.
        Convoys are represented by a <span class="highlight">'C'</span> and each battleship is
        represented by the first letter of its name. If necessary, all
        three characters will represent ships. For instance, a sequence of <span class="highlight">'KBC'</span> means that the German battleship
        Bismarck, the British battleship King George V, and a
        convoy all occupy the same grid zone. The order of
        characters is irrelevant.</p>
    <h3>BEGINNING THE GAME</h3>
    <p>At the beginning of the game, the computer will
        initialize a sequence of pseudo-random numbers which
        will determine the initial British positions and will also be
        used throughout the game to simulate chance events. The
        computer will then print a title and a list of the British
        battleships. After a few seconds of calculation, the first
        Strategic Turn will begin in foggy weather.</p>
    <h3>STRATEGIC TURNS</h3>
    <p>There are two types of game turns: Strategic Turns
        and Tactical Turns. The Strategic Turn begins with a
        printing of the 12 x 12 ocean map, including all convoys
        and battleships which are currently spotted. Useful information, such as damage and remaining fuel, is printed
        on
        the map display. After printing the grid, the computer
        will ask for a command. Typing an H followed by pressing ENTER will signal the computer for a change of
        heading. Pressing ENTER will use the current heading. After requesting the new heading (if
        necessary), the computer will ask how many hours to
        continue on course. Unless otherwise directed, the computer will not begin a new Strategic Turn until the input
        number of hours has elapsed.</p>
    <h3>TACTICAL TURNS</h3>
    <p>Each Strategic Turn will contain one or more Tactical
        Turns. A Tactical Turn is approximately thirty minutes
        to one hour of time. During the Tactical Turns, the computer does not normally require input. Messages will be
        typed on the screen to inform the player of events which
        transpire. When a major change occurs in the tactical
        situation, the computer will print a message and then
        wait approximately 4 seconds. Before beginning each
        new Tactical Turn, the computer will check for any input
        on the keyboard <span class="highlight">Or pressing the INTERRUPT button</span> (holding down the space bar, for
        instance). Ifthere is any input, a new Strategic Turn will be
        started immediately. In this way, the player can interrupt
        the Tactical Turns if necessary.</p>
    <h3>COMBAT</h3>
    <p>The Bismarck will fire its guns each Tactical Turn
        when sufficiently close to a British convoy or battleship.
        No input is necessary to fire at a convoy; it will be done
        automatically and the number of sinkings will be
        reported. When combat is necessary with a battleship,
        the computer will ask for a target ship. The player should
        reply with the name (the first character is sufficient) 0 f
        the battleship at which he wishes to fire, or press ENTER
        ('E' for PET) in case he wishes to attempt to withdraw
        from combat. In case the Bismarck has lost all firepower,
        an automatic withdrawal attempt will be made and no input is required.</p>
    <h3>WEATHER AND LIGHT CONDITIONS</h3>
    <p>There are two types of weather and two types oflight
        conditions. During clear weather, the British Home Fleet
        is assumed to know the position, course, and speed ofthe
        Bismarck, and will plot intercepts accordingly. During
        foggy weather, the British Home Fleet will rely on the last
        course computed during clear weather. The light conditions are simply day and night. Night lasts from 2100
        hours to 0400 hours. During the night, British gunnery is
        less accurate and air search is impossible.</p>
    <h3>MISCELLANEOUS DETAILS OF PLAY</h3>
    <p>Headings are in standard compass degrees: 360 or 0 is
        north (up on the screen), 90 is east (right), 180 is south
        (down), and 270 is west (left). All convoys head due west
        at 10 knots. Occasionally, a convoy that has moved off
        the display is still close enough to be fired upon by
        Bismarck at the utmost western edge of the grid. Speed is
        measured in knots and fuel remaining is measured in
        hours. Heading east off the grid at a port zone will end
        the game.</p>
    <h3>VICTORY</h3>
    <p>The victory conditions are. heavily weighted toward
        the British (computer) to compensate for inferior ships
        and lack of a sophisticated strategy. Simply sinking one
        British battleship and then returning to port is not good
        enough. The game ends when the Bismarck is sunk or
        returns to a port, at which time the victor and level of victory are printed.</p>
